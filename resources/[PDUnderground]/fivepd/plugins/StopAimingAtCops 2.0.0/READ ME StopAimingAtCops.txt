>>>>What this mod does:
Every second, the mod scans through the peds in the world and check if they are part of any emergency service.
If it finds any, it will DISABLE AUTO-AIM on him/her.
>You can still shoot them by free-aiming.
>Any ped not in the list below will not get protected (so you can still auto-aim at pedestrians etc).
